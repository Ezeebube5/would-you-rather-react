# Would You Rather Project
This project was created as part of [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

This application is created with React and Redux to manage state. Users have to login to create questions and also vote on questions other users have created. Authenication is mocked and users can view the leaderboard of votes based on number of questions asked and number of votes.

### Packages used:
    "react": "^16.4.2",
    "react-addons-css-transition-group": "^15.6.2",
    "react-bootstrap": "^0.32.3",

## Getting Started

The following instructions would get you started with the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node/npm [[download]](https://nodejs.org/en/)


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
